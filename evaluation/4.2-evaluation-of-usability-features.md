# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                  | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a map layout that can be easily understood by players | Success      |

### Feature 1

The map-layout was simple and easy to understand and most of the players said they liked it on the survey. Even the people who said that it could be different sent in constructive feedback that would be used in future development

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                     | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through | Fail         |
| 2           | Use controls that are easy to understand for gamers of all ages | Success      |

### Feature 1

The menu system that I had planned was not developed due to the reasons mentioned. That is why this is a failure. It would have been very good to have a menu and it would have made the game more professional.

### Feature 2

The use of the arrow keys for my game was chosen deliberately for this criterion. I wanted the most basic controls so that it was easy to understand for gamers of all age groups. Arrow keys were perfect to fulfil this.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                                                | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Have a level system so that the player has to work towards the final level | Success      |
| 2           | Implement a timer for players to have an incentive to beat their time      | Fail         |
| 3           | Include in-game art that is engaging and fits the style of the game        | Success      |

### Feature 1

The level system of 4 levels and then a final 5th boss level worked well. The survey suggested that the players agreed. There was feedback for it for future development from the survey too which I have addressed.

### Feature 2

The timer that I planned so that players would have an incentive to keep playing after their first win was not developed. This is why it is a failure. I planned for the timer because the incentive to keep playing was fairly crucial to me, but the lack of development for it was caused by a lack of a particular set of skills to code the personal best time and store it for the player to attempt to beat it.

### Feature 3



## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                             | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game doesn't crash                                                  | Success      |
| 2           | There are no bugs/errors during the player's experience whilst playing. | Success      |

### Feature 1

After testing for any crashes, were none that was reported. The testing included putting the game under a lot of stress by doing lots of unusual inputs/movements or making lots of apps run at the same time. Even after this, there was no crashing, which is why this was a success. However, it is important to realise that part of that may have been caused by the computer that it was tested on being better than average. On the other hand, after a survey from players of the game, there were no reported crashes.

### Feature 2

Similar to feature 1, after testing and putting the game under lots of stress there were no detected bugs/errors. However, there was one reported one which was addressed so I consider this a success.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                             | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Make all additional features simple so that they are easy to understand | Success      |
| 2           | Make the game not too challenging for players                           | Success      |

### Feature 1

The survey would suggest that most of the players thought that all the additional features were easy to understand and that they did fit the game. I would therefore consider this a success. Additionally, the players who still said that the additional features were easy to understand, still gave perfect feedback for future development which I have addressed.

### Feature 2

The survey would also suggest that the game was not too challenging for players. I would consider this a fail because there was only one player who found the game too challenging and this has been addressed. Furthermore, the aim was never to have a game that was too challenging so that the game was good fun for gamers of all age groups.
