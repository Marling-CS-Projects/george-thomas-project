### Criterion 1

The controls were developed in a basic way using the arrow keys for the movement: left arrow for left, right arrow for right. The spacebar was also included for jumping which was needed so it could be further developed into combat.

### Criterion 2

Attack controls were successfully added where the player would use the space bar to jump on top of the enemy to defeat them. The other option was to use the left click to punch the enemy. However, there were two reasons that made the idea of jumping on the enemy make more sense. Firstly, I liked the idea of having a twist from real boxing, this is because it gave a more retro video game feel which was the aim. Secondly, the development of punching and all of the animations that would have to go into it would take a longer time, therefore, due to time constraints it made more sense to go for the space bar.

### Criterion 3

From the video, you can see that the camera is side-scrolling and follows the player. This was the plan and therefore this went successfully. There was no other plan for the camera as I had always wanted the side-scrolling camera. I always wanted it because I feel it fits the retro style of the game similar to the old Super Mario.

### Criterion 4 - Not Met

This success criteria featured the player-fighting animations. This would have been developed at the end of the development process. However, due to time constraints, I was unable to complete this criteria. It is a shame because adding these animations would have made the game feel more professional and it would have fitted perfectly to the retro style. The animations for fighting were planned in my mind, featuring a 2 frame animation, one frame for stand-still and one frame for arm-stretch-out punching. As it turns out, that plan for the fighting animations would not have worked with the final product because of the jumping style combat which I preferred.

### Criterion 5 - Not Met

Similar to the fighting animations, it would have been really good to have these animations in the game as it would have made the game suit the retro style even better. The movement animations would have been a sequence of frames for the player and the enemy characters to cycle through as they ran. However, due to time constraints, and as this was a low priority for the development of my game, I did not meet the criteria. However, this would definitely be added to the development in the future.

### Criterion 6

The water-bottle power-up was coded, designed, and spawned in just how it was envisioned. This was a great success. The video shows that the player picks up the water bottle and it increases the player's hitbox to make it easier to defeat the enemy. This is exactly how it was described in the success criteria.

### Criterion 7

[Success criteria](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md) for enemies (Reference number 7): "Enemies will be in separate boxing rings that attempt to defeat the player. When the player enters the ring, the enemy will patrol their boxing ring. If the enemy collides with the player, the game will end. Enemies will not have the ability to jump so that they cannot leave the boxing ring. This means that the player will only be fighting the enemy inside of the boxing ring."

The video shows that the success criteria are correct for the movement aspect. However, in my success criteria for enemys I mention that "If the enemy collides with the player, the game will end." however this is not how the final result ended up. This is because during development I realised that it was a mistake to add this because there was a health bar system implemented.

As you can see from this video from cycle 7, the health bar development made the success criteria incorrect.
