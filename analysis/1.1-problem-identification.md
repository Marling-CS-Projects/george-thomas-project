# 1.1 Problem Identification

Video games began way back in 1958 with the physician-made computer game by William Higinbotham. The game was a simple 'tennis' type game, incredibly similar to the 1970s favourite 'Pong'. Higinbotham and his companion Robert Dvorak created drawings, and blueprints, and built the device. The two called the game "Tennis for Two" ([Tretkoff, E. 2008](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200810/physicshistory.cfm)). People who played their game were faced with a "two-dimensional, side view of a tennis court on the oscilloscope screen". It used a cathode-ray tube that had similarities to a black-and-white television tube. The tennis ball in the game was a brightly lit moving ball that left trails behind as it "bounced to alternating sides of the net". The players were presented with controllers that had buttons and rotating dials to use to "control the angle of an invisible tennis racquet's swing. The players used this to serve and volley the dot to each other. ([www.bnl.gov, n.d.](https://www.bnl.gov/about/history/firstvideo.php))

It was apparent that the game was the most popular at the laboratory that it was founded in. The game would then path the way for further games such as Space Invaders. Since then, the computer game industry has become an extremely profitable market, expecting to reach "US$372.00bn" in 2023. The growth of the industry will further continue as revenue is "expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2027) of 7.80%". This would mean that by 2027, the market volume would be "US$502.40bn" by 2027. ([Statista, 2022](https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/video-games/worldwide))

Now with an understanding of the impressive amounts of money involved with the computer game industry, it is important to know which direction to head in terms of which computer game genre to capitalise on the impressive amounts of money involved with the industry. Research shows that Shooter games and Action Adventure games are tied as the most popular among different sets of age groups with 66% of 16-24 years old's who play computer games playing Shooters, and 62% playing Action adventure ([Clement, J. 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1263585/top-video-game-genres-worldwide-by-age/)). However, what is interesting is that 2D games are making the list of popular video game genres, with Puzzle and Action platformers featuring 36% of 16-24-year-old gamers who play them and 31% of 55-64-year-old video game players.

From this information, I explored further the genre of Platformers. The famous versions include, Donkey Kong from 1981, Super Mario Bros 1985, Ghosts 'n Goblins 1985, Prince of Persia 1989, Turrican 2 1991, and Sonic the Hedgehog 1991 showing that the platform game has an incredible history and has developed from the oldest consoles to the latest titles playable today. Platformer games were highly successful to the point that they still exploded even with the appearance of 3D consoles. ([Evenden, I. 2021](https://www.stuff.tv/features/25-best-platform-games-ever/))

But what makes platformers so popular? Platformer-type games for a start are extremely nostalgic. Having been around since the early eighties, platformer games have been played by nearly everyone who played video games. Games mentioned above, especially Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario, have been a part of so many gamers' childhoods. Furthermore, platformer games are simple to understand, quick forms of fun, and addictive to get better scores each time. Although it is clear that the current market is filled with 3D shooters like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Call of Duty ([SteamDB, 2023](https://steamdb.info/charts/?tagid=1663\&sort=peak)), there are still 2D platformer games in the current market with a good amount of players. Firstly, the new versions of the original Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog are in the current market. Secondly, new faces such as Terraria and Brawlhalla, both 2D platform games with 10,000+ concurrent players daily. Terraria itself has experienced an all-time peak of "489,886" concurrent players. (SteamDB, 2023)

The 2D platformer was the dominant gaming genre in video games back in the 80s and 90s (Helgeson, M, n.d.). Additionally, they were extremely successful financially with Mario becoming the second-highest-grossing video game franchise in the world, with it being compromised mostly by 2D platformer games (Hallman, C, 2020). All platformer games follow similar goals, but this means that the themes and aesthetics of each one can be unique. Hence, it is a suitable path to follow and create a platformer that is different and fun for gamers to enjoy.
