# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

Development requirements are the specific things that must be done or achieved during the process of creating a software product, like a computer game. They include things like what programming language to use, what features the game should have, how it should look and feel, how it should be tested, and how it should be deployed. Development requirements are important because they help ensure that the final product meets the client's needs, works as expected, and is of high quality.

Therefore, in computer game development, the development requirements refer to the necessary software and hardware components that are required for creating and running a project. For my game, I want the requirements to run my game to be low, allowing for it to be played on web browsers.&#x20;

## User Requirements

Describe what a user will need to run the solution

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="OS1" %}
