# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

Development requirements are the specific things that must be done or achieved during the process of creating a software product, like a computer game. They include things like what programming language to use, what features the game should have, how it should look and feel, how it should be tested, and how it should be deployed. Development requirements are important because they help ensure that the final product meets the client's needs, works as expected, and is of high quality.

Therefore, in computer game development, the development requirements refer to the necessary software and hardware components that are required for creating a project. For my game, I want the requirements to run my game to be low, allowing for it to be played on web browsers.&#x20;

## User Requirements

User requirements related to hardware and software during the process of developing a computer game relate to what computer specifications the user needs to run the game. Therefore, as my game will be run on browsers, it is important to understand which browsers will be used and what hardware is required to run the game on each browser.
