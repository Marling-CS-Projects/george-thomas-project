# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

Now we know from [1.1](1.1-problem-identification.md), the industry of computer games is very financially successful, and that the popular 2D platformer games still see 10+ thousand concurrent players daily. It is important to capitalise on that fact by having a good understanding of the Target Audience and what the players would want to get out of playing my game. First I researched the age groups that play video games in [1.1](1.1-problem-identification.md) to give an understanding of the overall audience for a computer game. However, I then researched the age groups that are more interested in the genre of 2D platformers. ([Clement, J, 2021](../reference-list.md)) Shows that the majority of gamers across all genres is 16-24 year olds.   But we already know that the 2D platformer genre sees more gamers of the age 25+, therefore the focus for my game would be to entertain grownups rather than teenagers.
