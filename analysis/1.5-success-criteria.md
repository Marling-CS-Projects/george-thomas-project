| 3        | Player Movement/Camera Movement | The player will move the character starting from one side of the platform map to the other. The screen will be fixed to the player (parallax) and will follow wherever the player moves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <ul><li>Mechanics: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-movement">Player Movement</a></li></ul> |
| 4        | Player Fighting                 | My character will have punching animations that have 2 frame sequences. Like mentioned in [1.4a](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md): a standstill frame, and an arm stretched out frame                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | <ul><li>Mechanics: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-movement">Player Movement</a></li></ul> |
| 5        | Player Animation                | My desire is for my character to exhibit movement particles while executing actions such as punching, jumping, and running. These particles should be basic, such as dust or wind particles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <ul><li>Mechanics: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-movement">Player Movement</a></li></ul> |
| 6        | Power-ups                       | 2 different power-ups that are picked up by the player when walked on. These will include; a water bottle which will replenish the players health if damaged by enemies, and boxing gloves which allow for the player to deal more damage per hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | <ul><li>Mechanics: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#power-ups">Power-ups</a></li></ul>             |
| 7        | Enemies                         | Enemies will be in seperate boxing rings that atempt to defeat the player. When the player enters the ring, the enemy will walk towards the player and hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <ul><li>Enemies: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement">Movement</a></li></ul>                 |
| 8        | Scoring/Timer                   | The aim of the game is to defeat different boxers to reach the title fight which is the final boss. Once the player does this once, I want an incentive for the player to do it over and over again. To do this, I aim for a timing system so the player can attempt to get new personal records each time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | <ul><li>User Interface: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#menu">Menu</a></li></ul>                  |

| 14       | Game-Layout                     | Similar to mentioned in 1.4a, the player's starting point will be the left side of the screen, where they will spawn on a platform designed with a boxing arena theme. Their objective is to travel towards the right side of the screen and confront the ultimate boxing boss. However, before reaching the final showdown, the player will have to engage in battles with various opponents in different boxing rings. To enter each ring, the player must jump over the ropes and engage in one-on-one combat with their adversary. Along the way, the player can collect power-ups that will assist them in their quest to become the boxing world champion. | <ul><li>User Interface: Level Design</li></ul>                                                                       |
