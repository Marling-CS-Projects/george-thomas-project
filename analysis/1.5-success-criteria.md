Like mentioned in <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md">1.4a</a>: a standstill frame and an arm stretched-out frame.</td><td><ul><li>Mechanics: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-movement">Player Movement</a></li><li>Research: <a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#street-fighter">Street Fighter</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Player Animation</td><td>My desire is for my character to exhibit movement particles while executing actions such as punching, jumping, and running.

Once the player does this once, I want an incentive for the player to do it over and over again. To do this, I aim for a timing system so the player can attempt to get new personal records each time.</td><td><ul><li>User Interface: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#menu">Menu</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Menu</td><td>As mentioned in <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md">1.4a</a>, I will have a simple game menu that displays the option to "Play or "Exit.

Their objective is to travel towards the right side of the screen and confront the ultimate boxing boss. However, before reaching the final showdown, the player will have to engage in battles with various opponents in different boxing rings. To enter each ring, the player must jump over the ropes and engage in one-on-one combat with their adversary. Along the way, the player can collect power-ups that will assist them in their quest to become the boxing world champion.</td><td><ul><li>User Interface: <a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#level-design">Level Design</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Difficulty</td><td>The game will not be too difficult to complete. The normal enemies will take 2 punches to defeat, and the Boss will take around 10. The enemies themselves will do damage to the player and it will take 5 hits to defeat the player.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Background</td><td>There will be some background touches to suit the theme of a boxing ring. This includes crowds, fake sponsor banners, and random gloves/boxing equipment.</td><td><ul><li>Research: <a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#super-mario-bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Graphics</td><td>The graphics will be pixelated giving it a retro feel.

### Non-functional

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th width="404">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>20</td><td>FPS rate</td><td>Minimum of 15-20 FPS. I intend for the possibility of it being this low as the style is pixelated with a retro feel. 20fps is still smooth and will allow players to have that nostalgic and entertaining experience that I aim for.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>PEGI rating</td><td>I want my game to have a PEGI rating of 12. Although my research shows that the sport of boxing and the player-base of platformers sees the use of 16+ year-olds, I do not aim for any gore/drugs etc. Therefore, a PEGI rating of 12 makes the most sense.</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi-ratings">PEGI Ratings</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Runnable on a web browser</td><td>I intend for my game to require very little to run it. Therefore, I want my game to be able to run on a web browser.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
