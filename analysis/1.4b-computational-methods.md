## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly allows you to think beyond the concrete and see the bigger picture. It helps you to analyse complex problems, identify patterns, and develop creative solutions. Visualisation is a powerful tool that can help imagine new possibilities, set goals, and focus your energy. When you combine abstract thinking with visualisation, you can unlock your full potential and achieve your goals.

In my project, I will use these techniques to develop different sections of my game:

1. Firstly, my games graphics and retro style for my fighters and background. This would better suit my game as the players and enemies have 2-frame punching animations.
2. Secondly, the theme of my game with the boxing ring themed background. The visualisation will enable me to have the perfect result for my players to enjoy.
