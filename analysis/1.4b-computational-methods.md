## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly allows you to think beyond the concrete and see the bigger picture. It helps you to analyse complex problems, identify patterns, and develop creative solutions. Visualisation is a powerful tool that can help imagine new possibilities, set goals, and focus your energy. When you combine abstract thinking with visualisation, you can unlock your full potential and achieve your goals.

In my project, I will use these techniques to develop different sections of my game:

1. Firstly, my game's graphics and retro style for my fighters and background. This would better suit my game as the players and enemies have 2-frame punching animations.
2. Secondly, the theme of my game with a boxing ring-themed background. The visualisation will give me the perfect result for my players to enjoy.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is an essential skill in computer science because it allows you to anticipate potential problems and develop solutions before they occur. This can help you to save time, reduce costs, and improve the overall quality of the project. By thinking ahead, you can also identify opportunities for innovation and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing field. Whether you're developing software, designing hardware, or working on a research project, thinking ahead is a valuable skill that can help you to achieve goals and advance your career.

When programming a computer game, thinking ahead involves anticipating potential issues that could arise during gameplay and designing the game in a way that addresses these issues.

For example, game developers may think ahead and design the game to be scalable, meaning that it can adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. This allows the game to be played on a variety of devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers, without compromising the user experience.

Another example of thinking ahead in game development is considering the potential for player fatigue or boredom. Developers may design the game with a variety of challenges, levels, and gameplay mechanics to keep players engaged and interested over an extended period of time. They may also include features such as leaderboards and achievements to incentivize continued play and provide a sense of progression for players.

I have thought ahead in this aspect as I will include a scoring/timed system ([1.4a, User Interface](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#user-interface)) in my game for the players to aim to beat. This gives my players an incentive to keep playing after completing my game.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Procedural thinking involves breaking down complex tasks into a series of smaller, simpler steps that can be followed in a logical order. This is useful in game development because games often involve complex interactions and behaviours that need to be programmed in a step-by-step manner. For example, a game developer may use procedural thinking to break down the task of controlling the movement of a game character into smaller steps, such as detecting input from the player, updating the position of the character, and handling collisions with other game objects.

Decomposition, on the other hand, involves breaking down a larger problem or task into smaller, more manageable parts. This is useful in game development because games often involve many different components that need to be programmed separately before being combined to create the final game. For example, a game developer may decompose the task of creating a game level into smaller parts such as designing the level layout, creating the game objects that will appear in the level, and programming the behaviour of those objects.

I will need to use these techniques to make sure that there is a structure in my development so that I do not get confused or do things in the wrong order. Procedural thinking makes any development problem become much more stress-free.

## Thinking Logically

Thinking logically is not only useful in game development but also in everyday life. Logical thinking is essential in creating a thorough and playable game that considers the most logical outcomes when encountering problems and finding solutions. The game must be designed to allow the player to control almost everything, including enemy response, shooting, movement, and level completion time. Therefore, the game must follow a logical sequence of events based on the player's actions. For example, the camera must accurately follow the player's movements, and enemies must have a patrol path and be able to detect the player's presence. To facilitate the player's movements, decisions must be made about the speed of movement and the keys bound to different directions. Saving player progress between levels, rather than during levels, is necessary to emulate the classic game format.

## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently in computer game development involves designing the game to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. In other words, the game should be able to perform multiple actions at the same time without slowing down or crashing.

Concurrent thinking is particularly important in game development because games often involve complex systems that need to be updated and executed simultaneously. For example, a game may need to update the player's position, track enemy movements, handle user input, and render graphics all at the same time. If these tasks are not managed concurrently, the game may become slow and unresponsive, which can negatively impact the user experience.
