# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

There are two requirements in my success criteria for testing for function and robustness. These two will be tested due to the game's development being stopped. It will be important to test these for assistance in any future developments.

| Criterion | Description                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 20        | FPS rate minimum 15-20fps                    |
| 22        | Runnable on a web browser and does not crash |

### Criterion 20

To test my FPS rate I used a bookmarklet that I added into my code from stats.js. It creates a small visual display in the top left of the screen, showing what the fps rate is. The game runs at 144fps which is far more than 20fps which was the minimum in my success criteria, so it has passed easily.

This screenshot shows the result of the fps test:

### Criterion 22

To test if the game crashes, I put my game under a lot of stress to see how it performed and dealt with it. I did it by doing lots of abnormal inputs. After doing so, the game did not crash. However, the game experienced some glitches which would not be ideal for the intended experience I would like to give players. Firstly, at some points, the player's character would randomly fall through the floor. Secondly, the enemy would sometimes change its patrol direction halfway through its journey to the other side of the ring. The enemy is always going from side to side in the boxing ring, but as a result of the stress I put on the game, the enemy would flip direction at random points. Lastly, the player would get stuck on a specific point on the last level (the roof), I mention this because this would only happen when I put a significant amount of stress on the game.

These bug tests are important for several reasons:

1. **Player Experience**: Bugs can disrupt the immersive experience of a single-player game. Even in a single-player game, unexpected behaviour, graphical glitches, or other issues can take players out of the game world, making the experience less enjoyable.
2. **Game Balance and Fairness**: Although there are no other players to compete against directly, bugs affecting game balance can still be relevant. For instance, if a character's jump height is inconsistent due to a bug, it can affect the player's ability to navigate levels, leading to frustration.
3. **Game Progression**: Bugs that prevent players from progressing through the game are highly relevant. If a level cannot be completed due to a bug, players might get stuck, unable to continue the story or explore new game content.
4. **Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring the game works well on different hardware configurations and platforms is crucial. Players might have various PC setups or different consoles, and the game should run smoothly on all of them to provide a consistent experience.
5. **Quality and Reputation**: Releasing a polished game is still vital for single-player experiences. Players expect a high-quality, bug-free game regardless of whether it's single-player or multiplayer. A buggy game can harm the reputation of the developer and impact sales of current and future titles.
6. **Post-Release Support**: While not as critical as in multiplayer games, post-release support is still necessary. Players might encounter bugs even in single-player games, and it's essential to provide patches and updates to address these issues, ensuring a positive experience for players after the game's release.

In summary, even in an offline single-player platformer game, ensuring a bug-free experience is vital for player satisfaction, the game's reputation, and the overall success of the title. Players expect a smooth, immersive experience, and thorough testing is essential to achieve this goal.
