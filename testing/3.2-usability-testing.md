# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

To test the usability of my game, I have needed to create a Google form for extra tests to see how the players of my game's experiences are. This Google form will test for 5 key points:

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Does the format of the game make sense? Do you know where to go/what to do when you spawn in?                                                 |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls easy to understand? Does the character/enemy move too fast/slow?                                                             |
| 3 - Engaging       | How enjoyable did you find the game? Would you keep playing the game? Did the game style and theme appeal to you?                             |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Does the game experience crashing? Have you encountered any errors or bugs whilst playing?                                                    |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Are the add-ons such as the health bar and the water bottle easy to understand? Do they make sense? Is the game too easy or too hard to play? |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.

## User Feedback

### Effective

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The responses suggest that most thought the game was well-formatted and they liked it. However, 2 responses were sent that gave constructive feedback for future development:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The first response about adding more levels makes perfect sense. The truth is that professional boxers have more fights before becoming champions. This would definitely be added in any future development. The same goes for the second response, increased health for the boss would be added in any future development.

### Efficient

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I am happy with this response however I also expected it. 5 was for "Very easy", 1 was for "Not easy at all". This is because I specifically planned to have easy-to-understand controls such as the arrow keys so that most gamers would be used to it.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5 was for "Makes perfect sense", and 1 was for "Makes no sense". This response was very good to see, this is because I had made a twist to the traditional boxing-style video game where the player has to jump on top of the enemy to defeat it. However, I was unsure if that meant that the players preferred it that way. Therefore I asked the following:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This response shows the majority was for the twist that I added to real-life boxing. However, there were a couple who would have preferred the punching like real boxing. Which was not a surprise to me.

### Engaging

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5 was for "Very enjoyable", 1 was for "Very unenjoyable". This response showed results that most players found the game enjoyable which was good to hear as that was one of my main aims.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It was good to see that the majority of the players liked the design of my characters. This was important for me as I spent a lot of time choosing or designing my characters as I wanted my game to have that retro video game feel for nostalgia for players.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The one person who said that they didn't like the player and enemy design mentioned that it would be better if they had animations. I completely agree, the game would look far more professional with animations, however, this criterion was planned but was not developed do to reasons mentioned in the evaluation.

### Error Tolerant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This result shows that none of the players experienced any crashes. This is great news because I had tested a lot to make sure that the game did not crash. For example, I put the game under a lot of stress to see its limit before it crashes.

### Easy to Learn

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This response shows that every player thought that the win-record system was easy to understand. This is because 5 was for "Very easy". This was good to see as it was always meant to be an easy-to-understand concept for the game.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The main result was that the players found that the water bottle power-up was understandable and that it fit the theme of the game. However, a couple of players gave feedback on how it could be improved which is addressed in the [Evaluation](broken-reference).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5 was for "Very easy". Similar to the win-record system, the health bar was found to be easy to understand by players.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| 15        | Difficulty.                   |
| 21        | Stick to planned PEGI rating. |

### Criterion 15

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5 was for "Very easy", and 1 was for "very difficult". This response shows that most people did not find the game too challenging yet none of the players said that the game was very easy which was reassuring to see as one of my main aims was to create an incentive to keep playing by not making the game too difficult.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This response was expected due to when I tested my game, it was quite easy in some areas. This response shows that most people's experience with the game was that it was more easy than it was hard. This makes sense because although I wanted there to be an incentive to keep playing by not making the game too easy, I also had a requirement where the PEGI rating was 3, meaning that the game was not to be made too challenging for the younger gamers.

### Criterion 21

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This result shows that all of the players thought that the game was suited for PEGI 3. This is perfect because that was the PEGI rating that was planned and documented in the [success criteria](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md) and [stakeholders](../analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md). This means that the players thought that the character design, player-to-enemy combat, player-to-boss combat, HUD, and "Win" scene, all did not include anything inappropriate. Nor did they think the game included anything which would frighten children.
