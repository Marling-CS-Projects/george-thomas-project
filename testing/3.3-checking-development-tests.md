However, player does not fall to the floor and land</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Run code with fixed gravity</td><td>Player spawns and lands on the boundary</td><td>As expected - the player falls, lands and does not go through the boundary</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Cycle 2 - Map Development

### Tests

## Cycle 4 - Level System

### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th width="87">Test</th><th width="127">Instructions</th><th width="223">What I expect</th><th width="208">What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Run code</td><td>New level design to run well, not crash, and have everything that is intended to be in. For example the new map flour</td><td>Player spawns on new map which looks correct</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Run code and move around to test portals and new levels</td><td>Player collides with portal correctly and spawns to the other level correctly</td><td>Player walks into the portal but spawns underneath the level</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Run code after correcting the false spawn point though the portals</td><td>Player walks through portal and spawns above ground</td><td>Player collides with portal and spawns above the ground.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Check all the new levels by traversing the map</td><td>All levels look well formatted and all have the unique designs</td><td>All levels are there, however the look of some of them are not that good. </td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Change the design on some of the levels</td><td>All levels look well formatted and all have the unique designs</td><td>Levels all look alot better.</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Cycle 5 - Enemies

### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th width="87">Test</th><th width="148">Instructions</th><th width="223">What I expect</th><th width="208">What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Run code with new symbols representing enemies</td><td>Enemies spawn in the correct locations on each of the levels. </td><td>Upon test travelling the map, the enemies all spawn in their correct locations in the different boxing rings.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>After adding the code for the enemy movement. Run the code and test that the enemies walk towards the player.</td><td>As the player enters the boxing ring, the enemy moves towards the player in attempt to defeat the player.</td><td>The enemys get caught on the sides of the boxing rings. Resulting in the enemies not walking towards the player and  rather getting stuck to a flour peice.</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Adapt to the error, change the enemy movement code and run.</td><td>Enemies patrol back and fourth their individual boxing rings. Rather than walking towards the player so that the bug fixes.</td><td>The enemies correctly patrol the boxing ring with their new "patrol" function.</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Cycle 6 - Power-ups

### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th width="82">Test</th><th width="139">Instructions</th><th width="223">What I expect</th><th width="177">What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Run code after implementing new win record </td><td>Combat to have a new addition where the enemy is defeated and the belt spawns from the sky and lands on the boxing ring floor</td><td>The belt does spawn and fall from the sky. However it does not land on the boxing ring floor.</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Run code after changing how the belt falls</td><td>The belt spawns after the enemy is defeated and lasts 4 seconds before disapearing.</td><td>The belt falls and then dissapears before going through the floor.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Add win record text top left and run code.</td><td>The top left starts by just saying "0". But adds +1 each time the player defeats an enemy.</td><td>The win record goes up by one after defeating an enemy. But not happy with the result, its just a plain single number on its own.</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Develop the win record and run again.</td><td>The top left starts with nothing, then after the enemy is defeated, a win record sentence appears with the win number increasing by 1 after each defeated enemy.</td><td>The win record works how expected</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Add water bottle power-up and run code</td><td>When the bottle is consumed by the player, the players hitbox increases.</td><td>The water bottle increases the players size.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Increase the amount that the player grows after colliding with the water-bottle</td><td>When the bottle is consumed, the player increases by an even greater size.</td><td>The player increases to a greater size as desired</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Cycle 7 - Health Bar & Boss

### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th width="87">Test</th><th width="136">Instructions</th><th width="223">What I expect</th><th width="208">What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Run code with the enemy combat included. Walk into the enemy and do not attempt to defeat the enemy.</td><td>Upon collision between the player and the enemy characters: the enemy will deal -35 damage to the player, the player to be defeated after 3 collisions as a result of the 100 total health becoming less than 0.</td><td>The player takes -35 damage each time a collision is made with the enemy. The player also is defeated after 3 collisions with the enemy.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Run code and get the player character to defeat the enemy.</td><td>The player will jump onto of the enemy and will defeat the enemy whilst taking no damage.</td><td>The player jumps on top of the enemy and the enemy is defeated. The player does not visibly take any damage as there is no health bar as of yet. Therefore this is technically a pass.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Run code after implementing health bar.</td><td>Health bar spawns as a black rectangle above the player. The health bar stays above the player at all times. The health bar is at the right height so that when the player takes the increase in size from the water-bottle the health bar is still on top of the players hitbox. The health bar decreases in size by a 1/3 each time a collision with the enemy is made. The health bar does not decrease in size when the player jumps on top of the enemy to defeat it.</td><td>All as expected apart from one problem: the players health bar decrease and the player takes damage when jumping on top of the enemy.</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Run code with new fix for previous problem.</td><td>Players health/health bar does not decrease upon a collision where the player jumps on top of the enemy. The enemy is defeated as normal</td><td>The players health bar does not decrease and the enemy is defeated after the player jumps on top of the enemy.</td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Cycle 8 - Design & Graphics

### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th width="85">Test</th><th width="143">Instructions</th><th width="223">What I expect</th><th width="208">What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Enter new sprites for the characters and run code. Check for all characters.</td><td>All new character designs have loaded in correctly. Including the boss.</td><td>The player, enemy, and boss characters all load in correctly.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Enter new sprites for the map floor and boxing rings.</td><td>The map floor and boxing rings have their new designs.</td><td>The player spawns on the new-look map floor and the new boxing ring style has also spawned in correcty.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Test the new map layout after the changes were made in the code.</td><td>The map layout has changed and there are no problems with the player traversing the map. Nor are there any bugs were the player may get caught on any part of the map.</td><td>The map layout loaded in correctly to fit the new code. The player does not experience any problem traversing the levels.</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Run the code and win the game to test the "Win" scene. </td><td>The Win scene begins after 2 seconds between defeating the boss. The Win scene spawns 9 characters which all fall downwards from the top of the screen. The text reads as expected and is formatted correctly.</td><td>All criteria applies. However the characters fall at too fast of a speed in my opinion. Therefore not a full pass.</td><td>Fail</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Run the code and re-check the "Win" scene.</td><td>The characters that spawn in the Win scene dont fall downwards too fast.</td><td>The characters fall at an acceptable and expected speed. </td><td>Pass</td></tr></tbody></table>
