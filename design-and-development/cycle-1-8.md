# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

### Design

In this cycle, the HUD will be designed and fully prepared. The main menu will be designed. A completion design will be added.

### Objectives

* [x] Spawn in enemies
* [x] Enable movement for enemies

### Usability Features

Non-functional aspects: Enemies that move in a way that is not too hard to defeat but is also not too easy for players.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```


```

## Development

### Outcome

Loading temporary sprites for the enemies

```javascript
loadSprite("enemy", "/sprites/ghosty.png")
loadSprite("boss", "/sprites/bag.png")
```

Adding symbols for enemies

```javascript
const LEVELS = [
	[
		"                                 ",
		"                                 ",
		"                                 ",
		"                                 ",
		"            -              -     ",
		"            -      >       -    @",
		"============----------------=====",
	],
	[
		"                                            ",
		"                                            ",
		"                                            ",
		"            -              -                ",
		"            -              -                ",
		"           --         >    -              @ ",
		"============----------------================",
	],
	[
		"                                                   ",
		"                                                   ",
		"                                    ---            ",
		"            -              -                       ",
		"           --              -                       ",
		"          ---           >  -                      @",
		"============----------------=====  ===  ===  ===  =",
	],
    [
		"                                                 ---------",
		"                                                --       @",
		"                                               --     ----",
		"            -              -                  --     --   ",
		"           --              -            -------     --    ",
		"          ---           >  -                       --     ",
		"============----------------============------------      ",
	],
	[
		"--------------------------------------------",
		"    -                                       ",
		"--- -                                       ",
		"  - -           -              -            ",
		"  - -          --              -            ",
		"  -           ---           0  -         @  ",
		"==---==========-----------------============",
	],
    
]
```

Defining symbols and setting them as enemies.

```javascript
		"0": () => [
			sprite("boss"),
			area(),
			anchor("bot"),
			body(),
			patrol(),
			offscreen({ hide: true }),
			"enemy",
		],
		">": () => [
			sprite("ghosty"),
			area(),
			anchor("bot"),
			body(),
			patrol(),
			offscreen({ hide: true }),
			"enemy",
		],
	},
}
```



```javascript
	player.onCollide("danger", () => {
		go("lose")
```

### Challenges

One big challenge in this section was figuring out how to make the enemy walk towards the player inside of the ring. Therefore I have changed my plan slightly, the boss will be the one that walks towards the player, which will be developed in future.

## Testing
